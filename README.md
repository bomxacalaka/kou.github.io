Privacy Policy for Kōu (TrackMaster64)

Effective date: 19/01/2026

This Privacy Policy explains how Kōu (“the App”) collects, uses, and shares information. The App is developed by Jorge Eduardo Dal Santo Caetano (“we,” “us,” or “our”).

Summary
- The App does not create accounts and does not transmit your entries to our servers.
- Location data is used only to provide core app functionality (maps, route recording).
- We do not use data for advertising or tracking.

Information We Collect

1) Location Data (Precise and Coarse)
- The App can collect precise location (including background location if you enable it) to:
  - Show your position on the map.
  - Attach location to door entries you log.
  - Record your route while you are working.
- This data is stored locally on your device.

2) App Usage and Diagnostics (from platform services)
- The App itself does not send analytics to our servers.
- Platform services (e.g., Apple or Google) and map tile providers may receive limited technical data (e.g., IP address, device information) when the App loads maps.

How We Use Information
- App Functionality: Provide maps, route recording, and location-based features.
- We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, or tracking.

Sharing of Information
We do not sell or share your personal data with data brokers or advertising networks.

Third-party services used by the App may receive limited data necessary to operate:
- Map tile providers (for map display):
  - OpenStreetMap, CARTO, Esri
- Leaflet CDN (web map assets, if used in your build):
  - unpkg.com

These services may receive IP address and map tile requests. They are used solely to provide map functionality.

Data Storage and Retention
- Your entries and location data are stored locally on your device.
- You can delete data at any time by removing entries or uninstalling the App.

Your Choices
- You can enable or disable location permissions in your device settings.
- If you disable location access, map and route features will be limited.

Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Security
We take reasonable steps to protect your information. Because data is stored on-device, your device security settings also affect protection.

International Users
If you use the App outside your country, your data may be processed by third-party services in other regions when loading maps.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted at:
